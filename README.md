# push_swap
Yerevan 42 push_swap 2022

There are three folders:
- Folder 1: contains files submitted for evaluation (*.h file and *.c files)
- Folder 2: contains subject.pdf, checker for MAC and for linux, and evaluation.pdf
- Folder 3: contains tester for push_swap

My algorythm gives 4 for 100 numbers and 2 for 500 numbers.. and it works great with equal or less than 5 numbers

Good resources:
- https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/random-number-generator.php (will provide you with random numbers)
- https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/push-swap-tutorial-fa746e6aba1e (explanation of radix sort.. it will be better than my algorithm)
- https://github.com/lmalki-h/push_swap_tester (i used this tester)
- https://github.com/LeoFu9487/push_swap_tester (maybe a better tester but i didn't use it)
